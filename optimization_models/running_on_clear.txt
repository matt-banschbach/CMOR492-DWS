### LOGGING IN AND COPYING FILES ###

# This command lets you log into the clear cluster.
    ssh [net_id]@ssh.clear.rice.edu
# so if your net id was 'aca3' you would enter:   ssh aca3@ssh.clear.rice.edu

# you then want to copy the model file onto the clear cluster. To do this run this command on your computer:
    scp [model_file] [net_id]@ssh.clear.rice.edu:~



### INITIALIZATION ###

# These two commands let you use gurobi_cl in the command line.
# I recommend pasting them at the end of your .tcshrc file so that is is automatically set up when you log in,
# but you can also just copy past them into the terminal directly after you log in
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/opt/jul1.10.5-gur11.0-depot/artifacts/1cf3993225db760f620b7a50047dda0abc07e2a1/lib"
    source /clear/apps/gurobi/gurobiEnv.csh

*** Troubleshooting Initialization ***
# try running just the 'source /clear/apps/gurobi/gurobiEnv.csh' command first and then run 'gurobi_cl --version' and see if it gives an error.
# if the error is something like 'gurobi_cl: error while loading shared libraries: libgurobi110.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory' then try running:
    find /opt/ -name "libgurobi110.so"
# and use one of the paths it gives for the ( setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/opt/jul1.10.5-gur11.0-depot/artifacts/1cf3993225db760f620b7a50047dda0abc07e2a1/lib" ) command you run
# If that doesn't solve it, I don't know


### RUNNING THE MODEL ##

# Run the command:
    gurobi_cl ResultFile=[solution_file] [model_file]
# Example:   gurobi_cl ResultFile=model.sol singleperiod_nocontext.lp
# The file extensions don't really matter, they are all text documents

# You can now copy the solution_file back to your computer with this command:
    scp [solution_file] [laptop_username]@[laptop_ip_address]:[path_to_copy_to]

# And you can process the result more by removing all zero-valued variables with this command:
    awk '$2>0 {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}' [solution_file] > [non_zero_solution_file]
